Hello. 

A bit about me. Hmm. Give me a minute on that. In the meantime, I want to tell you about a few ideas I have. 

To put things in order, the primary idea would be to focus first on my internal environment. Since I am a human, this could also be relative to other humans...

So, internal environment. Things pertaining to my mental and physical health which set a tone and a basis for all my other thoughts and actions. Of course we all know that this means to eat well and exercise, to take care of our sleep and to take time to rest and for stress relief. But. But we are all so busy and full to the brim with cognitive dissonance. Our minds are so powerful that we fool ourselves and live in a vacuum relative to all that we do not want to pay attention to. 

Anyway. The idea is to put into practice better habits which lead to higher levels of health and well-being. To replace bad with good and good with better and better. Not only in myself but in a way that I could help others to do the same.
